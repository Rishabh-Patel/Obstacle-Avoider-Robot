This project aims to design and create a robot using simple Arduino Uno board.
C++ is used to create this robot along with some basic knowledge of Arduino IDE.

The image of circuit file is attached.

The code is also provided.
The text file provides the arduino code needed to run the robot.
DISCLAIMER--
//In order to run the code you need to put the .ino file in a folder which has the same name as the file.//
//Otherwise it won't run.//

DEVICES USED-
1)1 Arduino Uno
2)2 motors
3)2 wheels
4)1 Motor Regulator
5)Chassis
6)12V Battery

NOTE - This was done under a project in IIT Bhilai Epsilon Club Introductory Workshop 2024-25.
